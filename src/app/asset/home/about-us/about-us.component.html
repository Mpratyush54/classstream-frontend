      <h3>Building Technology</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Pratyush Mishra</strong> — a full stack developer and computer engineering student passionate about creating meaningful, real-world solutions.  
        I’ve spent the last few years developing systems that blend technology with purpose, from <strong>school management platforms</strong> to <strong>secure video streaming and AI-based monitoring tools</strong>.
